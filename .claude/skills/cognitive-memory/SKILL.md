# Cognitive Memory System v2

> Memory as stewardship: what we remember shapes how we serve.

## What's New in v2

- **Semantic search**: TF-IDF + cosine similarity replaces keyword matching. "deworming resistance" finds "FAMACHA scoring" and "parasite resistance" even without shared words.
- **Memory versioning**: `update` creates a new version, preserves the original with `supersedes` chain.
- **Knowledge graph**: `link` creates bidirectional edges between related memories.
- **Duplicate detection**: `consolidate` flags memories with >80% similarity.
- **Recency boost**: Recent memories score higher. Old unrecalled memories decay.

## Overview

This skill provides persistent cognitive memory across Claude Code sessions. It is NOT a database — it is a reasoning layer that encodes selectively, consolidates contradictions, recalls semantically, and forgets intentionally.

**Memory store:** `~/.memory/DOMAIN/`
**Operations script:** `/home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py`

## Session Start Protocol

At the beginning of every session, recall relevant memories:

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py recall "" --domain photography --limit 10
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py tree --domain photography
```

Present a brief summary to the user:
- Recent changes and current state
- Open questions or low-confidence memories
- Any contradictions flagged but not yet resolved

## Seven Cognitive Operations

### 1. REMEMBER — Encode new knowledge

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py encode photography <type> "content" \
  --tags tag1,tag2 --related id1,id2
```

**Types:** insight, decision, pattern, fact, preference

**Importance → confidence mapping:**
- 0.9: Critical decisions, corrections, structural changes
- 0.7: Important observations, verified facts
- 0.5: General notes, routine work
- 0.3: Temporary states, minor observations

### 2. RECALL — Semantic search

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py recall "natural language query" --domain photography --limit 10
```

Recall now uses TF-IDF semantic matching. You don't need exact keywords — conceptually related memories surface automatically. Each result includes a `_score` field.

**Trust but verify:** If a recalled memory has low confidence or a low score, say so. Don't present uncertain memories as facts.

### 3. UPDATE — Version a memory

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py update <id> "corrected content" --domain photography
```

Creates a new version. The old memory is preserved with reduced confidence and a `superseded_by` pointer. Use this when facts change — don't forget and re-encode, update.

### 4. LINK — Connect related memories

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py link <id_a> <id_b>
```

Creates a bidirectional edge. Use when you discover two memories are related — a breeding decision connects to a flock validation insight, a recipe correction connects to a transcription note.

### 5. CONSOLIDATE — Maintain memory health

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py consolidate --domain photography
```

Decays unrecalled memories, removes dead ones, and reports potential duplicates (>80% similarity). Run periodically or at session end.

### 6. TREE — See what we know

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py tree --domain photography
```

Shows memory count, types, edge connections, and version chains per domain.

### 7. FORGET — Intentional removal

```bash
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py forget <id> --domain photography
```

## What Memory Is NOT

- Memory does NOT replace primary data files in this repository
- Memory does NOT override primary sources
- Memory does NOT store raw data — it stores *conclusions about* data
- Memory does NOT act autonomously — you decide when to remember and recall

## Soli Deo Gloria

Careful, not clever. What we remember matters. What we forget matters too.

## Domain-Specific: Photography E-Commerce (Flickers of Majesty)

### What to Encode
- **Product decisions**: Why a print was added/removed, pricing changes, sizing decisions
- **Design patterns**: What worked for product pages, gallery layouts, conversion insights
- **Voice calibration**: Descriptions that passed voice-audit vs. ones that drifted
- **Technical lessons**: Image processing quirks, WebP conversion issues, print lab requirements
- **Customer patterns**: What buyers respond to (without storing personal data)

### Encoding Patterns

```bash
# After adding a new product
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py encode photography decision \
  "Mountain Majesty added at $49-$299 range. Metal prints for this image because the blacks need to go absolute. Canvas softens it too much." \
  --tags mountain-majesty,product,pricing,metal

# After a voice lesson
python3 /home/user/ken/orchestrator/memory_ops.py encode photography pattern \
  "Product descriptions work best at 2-3 sentences. One about the moment, one about the medium, one about where it belongs. Anything more reads like catalog copy." \
  --tags voice,product-description,pattern
```

### What NOT to Encode
- Product HTML (that's in the product pages)
- CSS standards (that's in the standards files)
- Image files or metadata
