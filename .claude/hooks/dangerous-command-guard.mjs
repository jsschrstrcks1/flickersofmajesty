// hardening (#2744: CMD_MAX_CHARS ceiling, the SIGKILL-able child-process scan deadline) that
// Project-Sophos's copy predates. A pure superset, not a union — nothing to merge in from there.

// Read + parse the event FIRST, so a minimal inline check can still run even if

// The stdin read is the guard's OWN trust boundary: until it finishes there is no command to
// inspect, so an unbounded read is an unbounded window in which the guard has decided NOTHING.
// Measured 2026-08-18 with inert `echo PROBE` payloads: stdin opened and never closed => this
// hook never returned a verdict, and two ORPHANED copies (PPID=1) spun at ~100% CPU for 19
// minutes. Bound it, and fail CLOSED on the bound — the same posture the detector-load path
// below already takes, for the same stated reason: a false block is an annoyance, a false pass
// is irreversible. The in-process bound is deliberately SHORTER than the `timeout` on this
// hook's `.claude/settings.json` entry, so THIS code decides rather than the harness's
// hook-timeout semantics, which are not specified to fail closed.
//
// `Number(x) || fallback` is deliberately NOT used: it maps a legitimate "0" to the fallback,
// which is exactly how a tuning knob silently loses its zero (UL-895).

// --- scan budget (#2744) -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The stdin bound above closes the read side. The SCAN side had no bound. Measured 2026-09-20 with inert
// strings, scanCommand() is quadratic in command length for a single long token (131,077 chars: 190.8 s) and
// for repeated wrappers (`eval eval ...`: 1.79 s at 2 KB, 7.24 s at 4 KB), and EXPONENTIAL for wrappers that
// carry a command substitution: `eval $(a) eval $(a) ...` took 16 ms at 64 chars, 295 ms at 128, 31.9 s at
// 192 and over 40 s at 256. The detector's own ceiling of 128 execution delimiters is far too high to bound
// that. The harness PROCEEDS when a PreToolUse hook times out (this repo's settings.json gives this hook 10 s;
// a user-level entry with no timeout runs 600 s), so a guard still scanning when its clock ends has, in
// effect, allowed the command, and a command of about 200 characters is enough to get there.
//
// Two ties, on different planes, because the ceiling is NOT a time bound and the deadline is the only thing
// that is. NO length is small enough to scan unguarded (the blow-up starts near 100 chars and a length
// threshold is exactly what an attacker picks around), so EVERY scan runs under the deadline:
//   DEADLINE: the scan runs in a child this process can SIGKILL, because the scan is synchronous JS and no
//     timer can interrupt it. Only a well-formed verdict from the child inside the budget can allow; every
//     other outcome (timeout, crash, garbage) is a DENY. The budget counts from PROCESS START (stdin wait,
//     import, spawn, scan) and must stay under the smallest harness timeout;
//     dangerous-command-scan-budget.test.mjs binds the two so they cannot drift.
//   CEILING: a command longer than CMD_MAX_CHARS is denied before any scan starts. A resource bound and a
//     second, size-based tie: it needs no child process, so it holds if spawning is what is broken. The
//     detector already refuses unreviewable shell structure the same way ("put complex logic in a reviewed
//     file"). Cost: a legitimate command over the ceiling is denied; use the Write tool for that text.
//
// A 0 for any knob is honoured (UL-895), but the budget has a floor so a 0 can never mean "no deadline".
// Root cause (the exponential recursion in the detector) is NOT fixed here; this makes it unable to fail open.
